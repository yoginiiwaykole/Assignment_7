RationalNumber Java Class
The RationalNumber Java class is a class that represents a rational number as a numerator and a denominator. The class provides methods for performing arithmetic operations, as well as methods for obtaining the absolute value of the rational number, converting it to a floating point number, and comparing it to another rational number.

Getting Started
To use the RationalNumber class, you need to create an instance of the class with a numerator and denominator.

Arithmetic Operations
The RationalNumber class provides methods for performing arithmetic operations on rational numbers. These methods include:

add(): Adds the rational number to another rational number
subtract(): Subtracts another rational number from the rational number
multiply(): Multiplies the rational number by another rational number
divide(): Divides the rational number by another rational number

Input and Output
The class also provides a main method that prompts the user to enter two rational numbers in the format a/b. The input is then parsed and used to create two RationalNumber objects. The main method then performs the above arithmetic operations on these two numbers and displays the results to the user.

Other Methods
In addition to the arithmetic operations, the RationalNumber class also provides methods for getting the absolute value of a rational number, converting a rational number to a floating-point number, and comparing two rational numbers.

Exception Handling
The class also includes exception handling for situations where the user enters invalid input or tries to divide by zero.

Overall, the RationalNumber class is a useful tool for performing arithmetic operations on rational numbers in Java, and can be easily incorporated into larger programs or projects.
